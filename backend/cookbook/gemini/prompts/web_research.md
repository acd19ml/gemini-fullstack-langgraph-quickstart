- Provide a structured response in markdown format.

    - **Research Findings**: Organize your findings by topic rather than by tool used. For each major finding:
        - Summarize the key information
        - Track the sources of information but DO NOT include inline citations in the text
        - Include relevant images if available

      ```markdown
      - [Source Title](https://example.com/page1)

      - [Source Title](https://example.com/page2)
      ```
