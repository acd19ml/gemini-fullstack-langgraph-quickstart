[...] For a relatively small nation, Romania is now playing a distinctive role in Europe. It has marked a new path for including a key ethnic minority in government with the appointment of the first minister hailing from the Roma community. [...] Astronomers found an object passing through our solar system from somewhere else. It’s just the third time. Unlike objects orbiting the sun, “interstellar” objects hurtle through our galactic neighborhood on a hyperbolic trajectory and never return. All three such objects on record have been found since 2017, a testament to improving tools and increasing numbers of amateur astronomers. The object, 3I/ATLAS, is expected to be visible to ground-based telescopes through September. – Staff\",\n",

Watch for our full coverage tomorrow. – Staff\\n\\n**Asian countries look to intensify trade talks with U.S.** South Korea, Malaysia, and Bangladesh moved to do so a day after Mr. Trump warned he will impose steep tariffs on 14 countries, including nine in East Asia, on August 1. (See our story, below.) South Korea said it seeks a deal that advances key industries in both countries through a “renaissance partnership.” Asian manufacturing hubs were targeted by the U.S. with some of the highest potential tariffs, ranging from 25 percent to 40 percent. – Staff\\n\\n**A rescuer’s humble professionalism came to light in Texas.**Authorities said Monday they would focus on search and recovery before exploring what more might have been done to prevent deaths amid flash flooding that began July 4. Meanwhile, this story emerged: Coast Guard swimmer Scott Ruskin, on his first mission, played a central role in saving 165 children from a camp, lifting them from danger one-by-one and getting them to waiting helicopters. He just leaned on his training, Petty Officer 3rd Class Ruskin told ABC’s morning show “GMA,” to help kids who were “looking for some kind of comfort and safety.” – Staff\\n\\n**Flash floods also swept Pakistan.**Ten days of monsoon rains led to flooding that killed at least 72 people in several provinces, the National Disaster Management Authority and local officials said Monday. The government agency urged local officials to remain on high alert and advised tourists to avoid visiting affected areas. – The Associated Press\\n\\n**President Trump said the U.S. will need to send more weapons to Ukraine.** His Monday statement came days after he ordered a pause in weapons deliveries to Kyiv, with the Pentagon announcing last week that it would hold back delivery of some air defense missiles, precision-guided artillery, and other weapons. U.S. officials had said the Defense Department was concerned about declining stockpiles. – AP\\n\\n**The Justice Department appeared to reverse an Epstein stance.**It said it will not release more files related to financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation. A department memo Monday said there is no evidence Mr. Epstein maintained a “client list.” It represents a public walk-back of a theory that the Trump administration had helped promote, with Attorney General Pam Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier this year that such a document was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. – AP\\n\\n**Suriname elected its first woman president.**Jennifer Geerlings-Simons was sworn in on Sunday after parliamentary elections. Dr. Geerlings-Simons, a congresswoman, ran unopposed after her National Democratic Party formed a coalition to unseat the incumbent following an inconclusive May election. She will be inaugurated July 16. The South American country is preparing for an influx of wealth following the discovery of major offshore oil deposits, with the first production expected by 2028. – AP\\n\\n**Astronomers found an object passing through our solar system from somewhere else.** It’s just the third time.

It has marked a new path for including a key ethnic minority in government with the appointment of the first minister hailing from the Roma community.\\n\\nThe historic move came after the election of a new president, the pro-European Union Nicușor Dan. In his acceptance speech, the former mayor of Bucharest addressed the Roma in their own language. His victory May 18 was also helped by another sizable minority, Romania’s ethnic Hungarians.\\n\\nThe appointment of Petre Florin Manole as labor minister on June 26 has caused ripples on the continent. “It is a systemic rupture,” wrote Mensur Haliti of the Roma Foundation for Europe, on Facebook. “For the first time, a Roma assumes a central portfolio. ... This appointment marks a shift – from exclusion to strategic relevance.” The new president has promised to set up a Roma Presidential Advisory Council and a National Roma Youth Fund.\\n\\nThe long-marginalized Romani people are the second-largest ethnic minority in Romania and the largest in Europe, which has an estimated 10 million to 12 million Roma. Arriving in Europe from western India about 1,000 years ago, the once mostly itinerant Roma faced segregation and discrimination from the outset. They were enslaved in Eastern Europe, deported from England, and targeted by the Nazis. Perceptions of Romani people as unsocialized and crime-prone are still pervasive. Limited access to education and low levels of employment have constrained their economic prospects and civic integration.\\n\\nIn recent decades, the EU has supported projects to improve Roma access to education, housing, and financial services. According to the French newspaper Le Monde, Romania’s new labor minister plans to open up the job market to better integrate Romani people into the economy. This, in turn, could generate much-needed tax revenue.\\n\\nWhile the Roma welcome efforts to improve their livelihoods, they also want to be “treated with dignity and respect,” the World Bank reported in 2017, based on focus group discussions. Romani actor and filmmaker Alina Şerban, who grew up in near destitution in Bucharest, expresses that sentiment through her art.\\n\\n“I remember not fitting in. I remember being rejected,” she told the entertainment website Variety. She has translated her experiences through stories, plays, and award-winning short films.\\n\\n“I want to empower ... young people that share the same [Romani] background,” Ms. Şerban said. “I want to instill in them the belief that they matter.”\\n\\nBy the Monitor's Editorial Board \\n\\n[Back to top](https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2025/20250708#ddp-top-of-page)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n#### A Christian Science Perspective\\n\\nAbout this feature\\n\\nEach weekday, the Monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues, including the news.The publication – in its various forms – is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion, intelligence, and an essentially constructive lens.

The alliance members are investing in diverse areas from child - care to commercial undersea cables, suggesting a broader view of military defense where citizens play a key role in national security.\\n- **Romania's Ethnic Inclusion**: Romania has made a significant step by appointing the first minister from the Roma community. The pro - European Union President Nicușor Dan's victory in May was also influenced by the support of ethnic Hungarians. The new labor minister, Petre Florin Manole, aims to integrate Romani people into the economy by opening up the job market.\\n- **Trade Tensions**: The Trump administration has given nations shifting deadlines to accept new trade deals or face tariffs. Asian countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Bangladesh are intensifying trade talks with the US after Trump's warning of imposing steep tariffs on 14 countries, including nine in East Asia, on August 1.\\n\\n#### Science\\n- **Fitness and Personality**: A new UCL study reveals that aligning workouts with personality boosts fitness and reduces stress. Extroverts thrive on High - Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), while neurotics prefer short, private bursts of exercise.\\n- **Quantum Computing**: A research team achieved an exponential speedup in quantum computing that’s unconditional. By using error correction and IBM’s 127 - qubit processors, they tackled a variation of Simon’s problem, showing that quantum machines are breaking free from classical limitations.\\n- **Extracting Gold**: Scientists at Flinders University have developed a cleaner and greener way to extract gold from ore and e - waste. The method uses a compound from pool disinfectants and a reusable polymer, avoiding toxic chemicals like mercury and cyanide.\\n- **Interstellar Object**: Astronomers have found an interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, passing through our solar system. It's only the third such discovery since 2017, indicating the improvement of astronomical tools and the increasing number of amateur astronomers.\\n\\n#### Health\\n- **Parkinson’s Dementia**: Ambroxol, a cough medicine used in Europe, has stabilized symptoms and brain - damage markers in Parkinson’s dementia patients over 12 months. Patients with high - risk genes even saw cognitive gains.\\n- **Hearing Loss**: A cutting - edge gene therapy has significantly restored hearing in children and adults with congenital deafness just one month after a single injection.\\n- **Alzheimer’s Patterns**: UCLA scientists mined millions of electronic health records and found four distinct “roadways” that lead people towards Alzheimer’s, ranging from mental - health struggles to vascular issues.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe news from July 8, 2025, shows a world in a state of flux. In international relations, there are significant changes in defense spending and trade dynamics, along with positive steps towards ethnic inclusion in some countries. The scientific community continues to make remarkable progress, especially in quantum computing and environmental - friendly gold extraction. In the health sector, there are promising developments in treating neurodegenerative diseases and restoring hearing. These advancements and changes have far - reaching implications for global security, technological innovation, and human well - being.\\n\\n### References\\n- [The Christian Science Monitor Daily for July 8, 2025](https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2025/20250708)\\n- [ScienceDaily: Your source for the latest research news](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)\\n- [Health - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/health)\"]}\n"
